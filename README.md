## Overview

This repository contains the complete solution to the final project for the course *Advanced Asset Management & Sustainable Finance*. The project is divided into two exercises focusing on:

1. **Mean-Variance Optimization and Portfolio Theory**
2. **Sustainable Investment and Climate-Constrained Portfolios**

The goal was to apply quantitative methods to construct and analyze investment portfolios under different risk, return, and sustainability constraints.

## Exercise 1: Portfolio Optimization

### Topics Covered

- CAPM: Expected returns, covariance, volatility, Sharpe ratio
- Mean-Variance Optimization with different constraints:
  - Long-short
  - Long-only
  - With and without a risk-free asset
- Efficient Frontier computation and visualization
- Analytical vs Brute-Force Tangency Portfolio
- Beta, Alpha, and Risk Decomposition (MR, RC, RC*)
- Diversification Ratio & Most Diversified Portfolio
- Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) Portfolio

Tools used:
- `cvxopt` for quadratic programming
- Matrix algebra and numerical optimization

---

## Exercise 2: Sustainable Portfolio Construction

### ESG & Climate Metrics

- **Carbon Intensity (CI)**
- **Carbon Momentum (CM)**
- **Green Intensity (GI)**
- **ESG Score (S)**

### Optimization Features

- Benchmark tracking under carbon reduction constraints
- Time-dependent CI reduction modeling
- Sectoral decomposition and exposure control
- Multi-constraint optimization (CI, GI, CM, S)
- Sector-neutral and sector-constrained portfolios

Advanced constraints:
- Dynamic tightening of CI constraint over time
- Simultaneous climate and ESG constraints
- Sector-based conditional carbon intensity limits

Tools used:
- `cvxpy` for flexible quadratic programming
- Custom Python scripts for metric evolution, visualization, and diagnostics

## Key Findings

- The **Sharpe ratio** remains constant along the positive segment of the efficient frontier with a risk-free asset, validating the **Two-Fund Separation Theorem**.
- **Long-only portfolios** show reduced diversification compared to long-short ones, but still perform competitively under proper allocation.
- Carbon constraints can be enforced **without significantly increasing tracking error** for short horizons.
- **Multi-constraint optimization** leads to more sustainable portfolios but increases deviation from the benchmark.
